Their products were widely used in several industries due to the heat-resistant, fire-resistant, and insulating properties of asbestos. Due to the risks associated with asbestos exposure, A-Best Products faced numerous lawsuits, eventually leading to bankruptcy in the late 1990s.","Aprons, Gloves, Overalls, Leggings, Blankets, Coats, Drop cloths, Mittens, Canvas, Fire blankets, Drapes, Carpeting",18000000,10567500,ABASTB,a-best-products.webp,30500,30500,30500,18%,6800,6800,6800,18%,2800,2800,2800,18%,1100,1100,1100,18%,1100,1100,1100,18%,http://www.abestasbestostrust.com/assets/documents/resources/Approved-Job-Sites-(Updated%206302017).xls,http://www.abestasbestostrust.com/assets/documents/resources/Notice-of-Trustee-Action-to-Reduce-Payment-Percentage-2020.pdf,http://www.abestasbestostrust.com/assets/documents/resources/Trust-Distribution-Procedures.pdf

B&W used asbestos as insulation in boilers. The use of asbestos was regulated, specified and encouraged by U.S. government agencies for decades, and was utilized in conformance with guidelines published by applicable regulatory bodies. After government regulations imposed low exposure thresholds for asbestos in the early 1970s, asbestos use by B&W was phased out.

On February 22, 2000, B&W and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This action offered the only viable legal process by which B&W could determine and comprehensively resolve asbestos liability claims.","Babcock & Wilcox Company Stirling Boiler, Babcock & Wilcox Gauges, Babcock & Wilcox Marine Boilers, Babcock & Wilcox FJ Furnace Boilers, Babcock & Wilcox Integral Furnace Boilers, Babcock & Wilcox Type E Pulverizers, Babcock & Wilcox Steam Generating Boiler Products, Babcock & Wilcox Insulating Firebrick",1850000000,372109600,BWATB,babcock-and-wilcox-company.webp,90000,120000,400000,6.30%,35000,45000,150000,6.30%,18500,22500,75000,6.30%,35000,37000,150000,6.30%,10000,10000,10000,6.30%,http://www.bwasbestostrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Copy-of-BW-Approved-Site-List-version-6.1-upload.xlsx,http://www.bwasbestostrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BW-Payment-Percentage-Notice.8.1.22-C1221410x9DB18.pdf,https://www.bwasbestostrust.com/file-a-claim/ir/ir-settlement/
